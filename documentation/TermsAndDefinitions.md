# Terms and definitions 

**SWD** (Serial Wire Debug): SWD is a debugging protocol used for ARM microcontroller development. It allows debugging and programming of microcontrollers using only two wires: one for data (SWDIO) and one for clock (SWCLK). On the Nucleo F401RE board, SWD is used for programming and debugging the STM32F401RE microcontroller.

**ITM** (Instrumentation Trace Macrocell): ITM is a feature present in some ARM microcontrollers that enables real-time tracing of code execution. The ITM can be used to send trace data, such as debugging messages or information about program execution, to a debugging tool or serial terminal for analysis. This can be helpful in understanding program behavior and diagnosing issues during embedded application development.
